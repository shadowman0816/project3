Payroll Event Processing - Transitional States & Status Flow

Introduction

This document outlines the various transitional states for payroll processing and how the statuses will be maintained across different tables in the system. The primary focus is to track event transitions across:
	•	Event Log Table
	•	Payroll Table
	•	Payroll Transaction Table
	•	Payee Transaction Table
	•	Retry Table

The document also explains the retry logic with cutoff conditions and the different statuses each table will hold at various steps in the process.

VALIDATION_FAILED
Validation failed; event rejected.
VALIDATION_SUCCESSFUL
Event validation completed successfully.
PROCESSOR_CONSUMED
Processor has picked up the event.
SAFE_PAY_SENT
Event sent to SafePay via Kafka.

2. Step-by-Step Status Flow

2.1 Payroll Processing (Same-Day Example)
	1.	Event Received: Payroll submitted event is logged in Event Log Table with EVENT_RECEIVED status.
	2.	Validation: Runs validation checks, updates status to VALIDATION_STARTED and then VALIDATION_SUCCESSFUL or VALIDATION_FAILED.
	3.	Processing Starts: Processor picks up event, updates status to PROCESSOR_CONSUMED.
	4.	SafePay: Payroll funds initiated, SAFE_PAY_SENT.
	5.	SafePay Response: SafePay responds, updates status to SAFE_PAY_RESPONSE_RECEIVED.
	6.	PASS Settlement: Transaction sent for settlement, updates to PASS_SENT.
	7.	PASS Response: Settlement response received, updates to PASS_RESPONSE_RECEIVED.
	8.	ACH Processing: If applicable, updates status to ACH_SENT.
	9.	ACH Response: ACH response received, updates status to ACH_RESPONSE_RECEIVED.
	10.	Completion: If all transactions succeed, the payroll status updates to PROCESS_COMPLETED.

2.2 Retry Logic (Back-Off Handling)
	•	If a step fails, a retry entry is created in the Retry Table with RETRY_SCHEDULED status.
	•	A retry scheduler job (EventBridge) picks up failed transactions and retries based on:
	•	Max retry attempts (e.g., 3 retries in 3 hours).
	•	Cutoff time (e.g., No retries allowed after 6:30 PM EST).
	•	If retries fail, status updates to RETRY_FAILED, otherwise to RETRY_SUCCESSFUL.

3. Conclusion

This document serves as a reference for tracking event statuses across multiple stages in payroll processing. It ensures visibility into each state, helps with error handling, and defines a robust retry mechanism to prevent loss of transactions due to transient failures.
