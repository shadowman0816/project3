Perfect! You’re in a great position to formalize this design with a structured document. Based on your notes and the image content (which includes retry-related fields and example payloads), here’s how we can proceed:

⸻

Your Goal

Create a document that:
	1.	Describes the end-to-end event flow.
	2.	Defines three types of payloads:
	•	From Event Manager → Event Processor
	•	From Event Processor Receiver → Event Processor (on Success from SBP via Kafka)
	•	From Event Processor Receiver → Event Processor (on FailureRetry, from Retry Outbox)

⸻

Step-by-Step Structure for the Document

1. Overview of Event Flow
	•	Webhook from CIB to Event Manager
	•	Event Manager publishes to SQS → Event Processor
	•	Event Processor makes an API call to PIM
	•	PIM interacts with SBP
	•	SBP sends success/failure events to Kafka
	•	Event Processor Receiver listens on Kafka
	•	On Success: sends event to Event Processor
	•	On Failure: stores in retry_outbox
	•	Scheduled job in Event Receiver reads retry_outbox and re-publishes to Event Processor

⸻

2. Payload: Event Manager → Event Processor
{
  "eventId": "uuid-123",
  "timestamp": 1673976552,
  "eventType": "payroll.process",
  "entityType": "Payroll",
  "entityId": "2447e450-d3b3-4118-8e17-72d1c470351c",
  "resourceType": "PAYROLL",
  "source": "EventManager"
}

Notes:
	•	eventType can be like payroll.process, payee.create, etc.
	•	resourceType defines the domain object
	•	source tracks origin of event

3. Payload: Event Processor Receiver → Event Processor (Kafka Success)
{
  "eventId": "uuid-456",
  "timestamp": 1673976552,
  "eventType": "provider.response",
  "entityType": "Payroll",
  "entityId": "2447e450-d3b3-4118-8e17-72d1c470351c",
  "responseType": "SafePay/PASS/SMBACH",
  "stepName": "SBPProviderResponse",
  "source": "Kafka",
  "payload": {
    "entireObject": { /* full provider response from SBP */ }
  }
}

4. Payload: Event Processor Receiver → Event Processor (Failure Retry)
{
  "eventId": "uuid-789",
  "timestamp": 1673976552,
  "eventType": "Retry/Monitor",
  "entityType": "Payroll",
  "entityId": "2447e450-d3b3-4118-8e17-72d1c470351c",
  "retry": {
    "retryCount": 2,
    "retryStatus": "Failure",
    "retryReason": "Timeout from PIM",
    "retryStepName": "SafePayAuthorization",
    "retryJourney": "PayrollRun"
  },
  "source": "RetryOutbox"
}

{
  "eventId": "uuid-789",
  "timestamp": 1673976552,
  "eventType": "Retry/Monitor",
  "entityType": "Payroll",
  "entityId": "2447e450-d3b3-4118-8e17-72d1c470351c",
  "retry": {

Yes, absolutely — responding with this email makes perfect sense, especially if:
	•	The people you’re addressing were part of yesterday’s call (or need visibility into it),
	•	You want to document key takeaways for alignment,
	•	And you’re trying to clarify the architectural flow for future discussions.

We can easily extend the email to mention yesterday’s meeting and incorporate your specific flow. Here’s a revised version of the message to include that:

Subject: Alignment on Architecture Flow – PIM/SBP Discussions & Upcoming Meeting

Hi [Team/Product/Name],

I wanted to take a moment to align on the ongoing architectural discussions around the updated event flow involving Payroll, PIM, and SBP.

As discussed in yesterday’s meeting with the PIM and SBP teams, one of the key confirmations was the updated orchestration:
	•	From Payroll → PIM → SBP for outbound flows, and
	•	From SBP → PIM → Payroll for inbound (response) flows.

This new flow replaces the previous direct integration pattern we had from CCB to SBP, and will form the basis of the revised recon and retry mechanisms.

Since there is another meeting already scheduled by the product team on Monday to go through the use cases and finalize direction with PIM/SBP, I’ll defer the placeholder I had set up to avoid duplicate conversations. I’ll go ahead and cancel that invite shortly.

That said, I’d like to continue contributing to the architectural alignment and will follow up after Monday’s session with any additional discussions needed—particularly around implications for recon, retry, and event-driven processing.

Thanks again for the collaboration and looking forward to moving this forward.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

This version:
	•	Summarizes the key technical direction from yesterday
	•	Aligns with product-led efforts for Monday
	•	Politely cancels your meeting
	•	Keeps you in the loop architecturally

Let me know if you want a shorter Teams message version too!
