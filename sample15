Hey team, quick point I wanted to bring up regarding the use of @Modifying with JPA for native or JPQL queries—especially in the context of our deployment architecture (ECS with Fargate and autoscaling).

I’m totally aligned with the direction to use @Modifying to ensure flushing behavior is enforced after executing custom queries. It works well for updating or deleting entities and makes sure changes are pushed to the database immediately. However, I do have a concern about potential race conditions that might arise due to the stateless, horizontally scaled nature of our services.

Since our services are containerized and can scale out (multiple instances running concurrently), here’s a scenario we should be careful about:
	•	Instance A picks up a record and performs a native update using a repository method annotated with @Modifying.
	•	Before the flush is committed, Instance B (in another container) fetches the same record (possibly via a standard JPA find/query).
	•	Now B may receive a stale or dirty version of the entity**, since the update from A isn’t flushed yet to the DB.

In tightly timed scenarios, especially under high load or with asynchronous consumers (e.g., reading from SQS or Kafka), this might introduce inconsistencies that are hard to debug.

A few additional points to consider:
	•	@Modifying works well in monolithic or synchronous flows but may not be enough to guarantee consistency in distributed systems where write and read can happen from different instances.
	•	JPA’s first-level cache (persistence context) is instance-bound. So when using native queries or JPQL with @Modifying, we bypass some of the entity-level guarantees like dirty checking and optimistic locking unless handled explicitly.
	•	One alternative might be to wrap critical operations in transactional boundaries with explicit versioning or use a distributed locking strategy where necessary (depending on how critical consistency is).
	•	Another safer approach (in some cases) is to prefer entity-based updates (i.e., load → modify → save) where optimistic locking is in play—especially for high-concurrency domains.

Just wanted to surface this now before we rely too heavily on @Modifying, assuming it will “just work” in a distributed, autoscaled environment. Happy to elaborate or help with a spike if needed.
