Hey team, quick point I wanted to bring up regarding the use of @Modifying with JPA for native or JPQL queries—especially in the context of our deployment architecture (ECS with Fargate and autoscaling).

I’m totally aligned with the direction to use @Modifying to ensure flushing behavior is enforced after executing custom queries. It works well for updating or deleting entities and makes sure changes are pushed to the database immediately. However, I do have a concern about potential race conditions that might arise due to the stateless, horizontally scaled nature of our services.

Since our services are containerized and can scale out (multiple instances running concurrently), here’s a scenario we should be careful about:
	•	Instance A picks up a record and performs a native update using a repository method annotated with @Modifying.
	•	Before the flush is committed, Instance B (in another container) fetches the same record (possibly via a standard JPA find/query).
	•	Now B may receive a stale or dirty version of the entity**, since the update from A isn’t flushed yet to the DB.

In tightly timed scenarios, especially under high load or with asynchronous consumers (e.g., reading from SQS or Kafka), this might introduce inconsistencies that are hard to debug.

A few additional points to consider:
	•	@Modifying works well in monolithic or synchronous flows but may not be enough to guarantee consistency in distributed systems where write and read can happen from different instances.
	•	JPA’s first-level cache (persistence context) is instance-bound. So when using native queries or JPQL with @Modifying, we bypass some of the entity-level guarantees like dirty checking and optimistic locking unless handled explicitly.
	•	One alternative might be to wrap critical operations in transactional boundaries with explicit versioning or use a distributed locking strategy where necessary (depending on how critical consistency is).
	•	Another safer approach (in some cases) is to prefer entity-based updates (i.e., load → modify → save) where optimistic locking is in play—especially for high-concurrency domains.

Just wanted to surface this now before we rely too heavily on @Modifying, assuming it will “just work” in a distributed, autoscaled environment. Happy to elaborate or help with a spike if needed.

Thanks for the response! I did go through the above thread again and just wanted to share a few thoughts and clarifications from my side. Not trying to challenge anything here—just aiming to ensure we’ve weighed all the options before finalizing the ORM strategy, especially in the context of our Fargate-based autoscaled services.

A few key points to consider:
	•	Aurora PostgreSQL already supports optimistic locking at the DB level using transaction isolation and row versioning. So my question is: do we really need to duplicate optimistic locking at the application layer via JPA versioning unless we’re doing object-level state management that requires it?
	•	When using native queries (which we are, in many places), especially with return types like Map<String, Object>, Hibernate’s first-level cache and entity tracking are bypassed. So:
	•	There’s no entity lifecycle (i.e., dirty checking, automatic flushes, or version control).
	•	Caching and optimistic locking from the ORM layer might not even apply unless we explicitly map the results to managed entities.
	•	In such scenarios, transactional consistency is better owned by the DB, not the app layer. That way:
	•	We avoid race conditions due to partial flushes.
	•	We don’t run into inconsistencies between what the app sees and what’s committed.
	•	Debugging is cleaner, since the DB owns commit and versioning logic end-to-end.
	•	If we truly need version-based optimistic locking, then ideally we should stick with entity-based updates (find → modify → save) rather than native queries, so JPA can manage version checks effectively.
	•	Also, is there a way (just putting this out for discussion) where we can map native query results to existing entities and still leverage some degree of entity management? If yes, we might get the best of both worlds—performance with consistency.

I’m happy to collaborate on a small spike or draft a proposal around this if it helps us evaluate this more structurally.

Also just a gentle note: it’d be great if we can all keep the tone collaborative in these discussions. I know things move fast, and we all feel strongly about stability—but I truly believe we’ll get the best results when we bring all perspectives to the table and question things together.
