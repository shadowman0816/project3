This document details the same-day payroll processing workflow, outlining each step from receiving the Gusto Webhook event to finalizing payroll via SafePay and ACH. It also includes failure handling, retry logic, and key considerations.
1️⃣ Gusto Webhook Received  
2️⃣ Validate & Enqueue in Event Manager  
3️⃣ Event Processor Determines Payroll Date  
4️⃣ Limit Check & Risk Evaluation  
5️⃣ SafePay Authorization  
6️⃣ ACH Processing & Finalization  


✅ If payroll date is today → Same-day Processing
❌ If payroll date is in the future → Future-dated Processing (handled separatel

Step-by-Step Process

Step 1: Receive & Validate Webhook Event

✅ Gusto sends payroll.submitted webhook event.
✅ The event contains:
	•	payrollId, companyId, payrollDate, amount, employeesList.
✅ The Event Manager validates and routes it to the SQS queue.

Step 2: Event Processor Determines Processing Type

✅ Reads event from SQS Queue (priority/non-priority).
✅ Fetches payroll details from Gusto via CIB Proxy API.
✅ Extracts payroll date and determines:
	•	Today? → Proceed with same-day flow ✅
	•	Future-dated? → Send to EventBridge for scheduled processing ⏳

Step 3: Risk & Limit Checks

✅ Calls Limit Check Service to validate payment threshold.
✅ Calls Risk Analysis (RBAD) for fraud screening.
✅ Calls Eligibility Check Service to ensure employer is allowed to process payroll.

Step 4: Route to SafePay

✅ If the payroll passes checks, it is sent to SafePay API for funding authorization.
✅ SafePay performs funding verification and returns:
	•	Funding Acquired ✅ → Proceed to ACH Processing.
	•	Funding Failed ❌ → Retry via EventBridge Scheduler (after 30 min).

Step 5: ACH Processing & Finalization

✅ If SafePay succeeds, the payroll moves to ACH Payment Processing.
✅ ACH collates payment instructions.
✅ ACH finalizes settlement at 8 PM EST.
✅ Employer receives confirmation notification.

Failure Point,Action Taken,Retry Mechanism
SafePay Authorization Fails,Retry after 30 minutes,EventBridge Scheduler
ACH Submission Fails,Queue for next business day processing,Manual Intervention
API Call to CIB Fails,Retry via Exponential Backoff,SQS Retry Queue
Duplicate Payroll Processing,Prevent via Deduplication Check,Event Log Lookup

Scenario,System Response
Employer cancels payroll after submission but before processing,Stop processing, mark Canceled in event log.
Employer cancels payroll after SafePay authorization but before ACH,SafePay PATCH API cancels payment, ACH not triggered.
Payroll submission close to 8 PM EST cutoff,If SafePay not completed, ACH is queued for next day.
Duplicate payroll event received,Deduplication logic prevents duplicate processing.
SafePay fails multiple times,Retry logic in EventBridge Scheduler to avoid infinite loops.
Payroll amount exceeds allowed limits,System routes to Counterparty Utility for manual review.
